              <h4>Although I am a Cyber Security major focusing more on back-end capabilities, this is my best attempt
	           at a website created from scratch. This website's purpose is to provide examples of my abilities/skills
	           and demonstrate the experience that I have acquired through my education. Additionally, this website
	           provides the option to download study materials and personal content that I want to access remotely.</h4>
